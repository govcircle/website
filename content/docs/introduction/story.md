Living in Iran means facing the consequences of centralized power and international sanctions — where the right to shape one’s future is often denied. In such an environment, the idea of freedom becomes more than a concept — it becomes a necessity.
When we discovered blockchain, and later Cardano’s vision for on-chain decentralized governance, we didn’t just see a new technology — we saw a new hope. A way to contribute to global governance models, to influence decisions that affect communities, and to help build systems where freedom, democracy, and accountability are not dictated by borders.
But that vision was challenged. Due to jurisdictional restrictions, Iranian contributors were blocked from joining Intersect and excluded from participating in MBOs — key players in Cardano's governance. That exclusion didn’t silence us. It motivated us.
We envisioned a new path — one that didn’t require permission to contribute. GovCircle emerged from this vision: a product of an Iranian-led MBO initiative that empowers all governance actors — DReps, SPOs, direct voters, Constitution Committee members, and more — to communicate, collaborate, and make transparent decisions on-chain.
For those of us who’ve lived without access to democracy, decentralized governance isn’t just a concept — it’s a form of resistance. It’s our way of contributing to a future where no one is left out because of where they’re born.
GovCircle isn’t just a tool — it’s our contribution to building a freer, more accountable world through blockchain.
